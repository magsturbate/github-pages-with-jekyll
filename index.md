I hate what J.K. Rowling has done to my relationship with Harry Potter

Those books were so good, and had such a profound effect on my childhood and my early teenage development years. But now every time that bitch opens her mouth, I'm like, "Jesus God."

Her views were somewhat progressive by the standards of the late 90s to early 2000s, but she's refused to update her outlooks along with the changing times, and I can only stand so much.

The third movie is definitely the best one.

But I think my favorite book is the fourth.
